      <h2>Who is Speedshop?</h2>

      <p>
        Speedshop is me,
        <a href="https://www.nateberkopec.com/"><b>Nate Berkopec</b></a>. I've been working on Ruby on Rails applications for almost 10 years, and I've taught thousands how to make their apps faster, more scalable, and more maintainable. I maintain Puma, the popular open-source Ruby applicaton server. You're probably running my code on your Rails server right now, somewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've given talks at dozens of conferences. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmEErUwnghlELuYrmNhIcDU0_KtXQIUpW">You can view some of those talks on YouTube.</a>

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Full-stack and user-first.</b> Your users have to go through
          the full stack to use your application - so we optimize at every
          level. All performance optimization flows from the end-user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Never underestimate developers.</b> Many performance tools,
          consultancies and teams today believe that developers only have a
          limited capacity to understand performance issues. Speedshop believes
          in the unlimited capacity of software developers to learn, and that
          even the most complex performance issue is not out of the reach of any.
        </li>
        <li><b>Performance and deployment are essentials, not luxuries.</b>
          All organizations have performance goals and targets,
          but they are left unstated. Is it acceptable for this page to load in
          more than 2 minutes? No? Then you have a requirement. What is measured is managed.
        </li>
        <li><b>Optimization without measurement is premature.</b> By applying a
          rigorous, scientific process to optimization
          we can be certain that optimizations are necessary and successful.
        </li>
        <li><b>Measurement is worthless without context.</b> Measurement is not
          a panacea. Relative
          benchmarking (% improved/faster) should generally not be used when
          an absolute benchmark (# of milliseconds/seconds faster) would be
          more relevant and provide more context. Metrics alone cannot help if
          they are not understood.
        </li>
        <li><b>Simple and fast are complements, not mutually exclusive.</b> We
          cannot optimize what we do not understand. Code that is simple is
          usually also fast. Optimizing code does not necessarily make it more
          complicated or harder to read.
        </li>
        <li><b>Experimentation over best practice.</b> Best-practice-driven
          development allows lazy decision-making. Instead, we can use precise
          measurement and abundant experimentation to determine what works in a
          specific organization.
        </li>
      </ul>
